## Status Overview (as of 2025-10-08)
- **Telemetry parity**: ✅ Complete — staging diff clean (`audit/telemetry-audit/latest-staging.json`).
- **Backfill tooling (CLI + metadata)**: ✅ Complete — daily windows populate with project/API/user context.
- **Constraint upsert via index**: ✅ Complete — Drizzle metadata now surfaces expression columns, upsert path active.
- **Cron rehearsal (48-hour staging run)**: ⏳ Pending — run cron job with monitoring per plan Workstream 2.
- **UI/API surfacing of new fields**: ⏳ Pending — dashboards and `/api/usage` not yet updated for window metadata.

# Daily Usage Progress Log

## 2025-10-08
- Enabled `usage_admin_bucket_idx` consumption by tolerating Drizzle SQL expressions, so constraint-based upsert works again (`src/lib/usage-fetcher.ts`).
- Hardened admin pagination sanitization to reject whitespace tokens and restored manual fallback telemetry (`tests/usageFetcherSecurity.test.ts`, `tests/usageFetcherConstraintFallback.test.ts`).
- Updated provider key API responses to share typed payloads and revalidated with `npx tsx tests/runAllTests.ts`.
- Bundled telemetry diff via esbuild (`npx esbuild scripts/usage-telemetry-diff.ts --bundle --outfile=tmp/usage-telemetry-diff.mjs --platform=node --format=esm`).
- Cleaned legacy `usage_events` rows lacking metadata using `tmp/cleanup_usage_events.sql` (deleted 16 blanks) and reran staging backfill (`pnpm usage:backfill --start 2025-09-01 --end 2025-10-01 --chunk-days 3 --label staging-post-servicetier`).
- Generated parity diff with bundled script (`direnv exec . node tmp/usage-telemetry-diff.mjs ...`); `audit/telemetry-audit/latest-staging.json` now reports zero missing/mismatched windows.
- Confirmed parity closure in memory bank (`memorybank/progress.md`) and closed context gap `GAP-2025-10-07-DAILY-USAGE-PARITY`.

## 2025-10-07
- Updated telemetry diff script to ignore blank metadata rows and documented change in `memorybank/daily_usage_alignment_plan.md`.
- Captured staging diff (`audit/telemetry-audit/2025-10-07T22-44-28Z-staging.json`) showing 46 missing windows; identified service tier as only remaining CSV-only dimension.
- Logged gap in `memorybank/context_gaps_log.md` and scheduled follow-up diff after migration + regrouping.

## 2025-10-02
- Executed staging backfill (`usage:backfill --start 2025-09-01 --end 2025-10-01 --chunk-days 3 --label staging-repair`) to populate window metadata; recorded results in `audit/backfill-rehearsal/`.
- Initial telemetry diff reconciliation captured in `audit/telemetry-audit/latest.json`; flagged missing windows awaiting admin grouping support.
