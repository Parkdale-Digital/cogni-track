# Context Gaps Log

- **Resolved:** 2025-10-08 – Staging backfill (`audit/backfill-rehearsal/2025-10-08-staging-post-servicetier.log`) plus bundled telemetry diff (`tmp/usage-telemetry-diff.mjs`) confirmed zero missing or mismatched windows (`audit/telemetry-audit/latest-staging.json`); parity now aligned after removing `service_tier` from comparison.

- **Resolved:** 2025-10-09 – GAP-2025-10-09-ANTHROPIC-DOCS closed after retrieving Anthropic Usage & Cost API documentation via Context7 (`/llmstxt/anthropic_llms_txt`), confirming endpoints `/v1/organizations/usage_report/messages`, `/v1/organizations/cost_report`, and `/v1/usage`.

## Review Cadence
- **Quarterly Sweep:** Cross-check `memorybank/progress.md` against `/audit` artefacts on the first business day of each quarter; log outcome in `memory_bank_review_log.md`.
