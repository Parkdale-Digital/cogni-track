2025-10-02 – Authored staging runbook for migration 0003_usage_event_windows and queued follow-up telemetry diff post-apply.
2025-10-02 – Ran staging telemetry diff (latest-staging.json); DB comparison succeeded after removing channel binding but 46 windows still missing pending backfill.
2025-10-07 – Captured staging diff (2025-10-07T14-23-48Z.json); Neon HTTP fetch failure still blocks DB comparison, leaving 46 windows missing.
2025-10-07 – Telemetry diff retry (2025-10-07T14-24-48Z.json) failed with Neon password auth; staging credentials need reissue before DB comparison.
2025-10-07 – Admin usage backfill hit 'undefined' column errors from usage_admin_bucket_idx metadata; planning manual dedupe fallback before rerunning telemetry diff.
2025-10-07 – Confirmed usage ingestion guard + manual dedupe fallback fixed the undefined column failure; local backfill (`pnpm usage:backfill --start 2025-09-15 --end 2025-09-16`) stored two windows, staging diff rerun pending new credentials.
2025-10-07 – Memory review after restoring Neon access, running dry-run/full telemetry diffs via esbuild bundle (artifacts 2025-10-07T22-44-11Z-dryrun.json / 2025-10-07T22-44-28Z-staging.json, SHA256 82c61d54326a363615fe257ee7e0ae1f778c6a7ba5ee28ebd93cb3245d18a019), and logging prerequisite checklist for nightly monitoring; confidence stays at 6/10 until instrumentation verifies the 46-missing-window gap closes.
2025-10-07 – Memory review after adding persistence counters to usage fetcher/cron/backfill telemetry, publishing synthetic fallback sample (`audit/telemetry-audit/synthetic-manual-fallback.json`), and checking off telemetry diff checklist items; confidence remains 6/10 pending live backfill validation of the 46-window gap.
2025-10-07 – Memory review after grouping the 46 missing staging windows (summary in `audit/telemetry-audit/missing-windows-summary-2025-10-07.md`); blank metadata rows appear zeroed while real gaps map to project `proj_MhIbP1DyoTSqH6k2DtXVKvvV` (keys `key_mPAw5OyZbONR4dAL`, `key_NF7ZLeXYAXECwqv7`). Confidence still 6/10 until rerun confirms manual fallback counters drop.
