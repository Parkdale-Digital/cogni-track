This section curates operational playbooks for the CogniTrack platform. Each runbook follows a consistent structure that covers prerequisites, validation steps, and owner handoffs so that incidents can be resolved quickly and safely.

## Runbook template

1. **Summary** — What the runbook addresses and the primary owners.
2. **Prerequisites** — Feature flags, environment variables, and tooling access needed to complete the task.
3. **Procedure** — Step-by-step instructions with embedded command snippets.
4. **Verification** — How to confirm success or roll back.
5. **Follow-up** — Links to Jira tickets, retrospectives, or documentation updates.

## Available runbooks

- Deployment checklist (coming soon)
- Cost anomaly investigation (coming soon)
- Integrations monitoring (coming soon)

> ⚠️ The runbook catalog is still under construction. As part of Phase 2, existing operational knowledge will migrate into this section.
