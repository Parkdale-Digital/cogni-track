# Welcome

CogniTrack Docs is the centralized home for onboarding, architecture decisions, and operational guides. These pages are generated with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and live alongside the codebase, enabling engineers to iterate on documentation with the same workflows used for application code.

## What you will find

- **Onboarding:** Start with the [Developer Onboarding Guide](product/developer-onboarding.md) for repo layout, setup steps, and validation commands.
- **Architecture references:** Review diagrams and data flows beginning with the [System Map](architecture/system-map.md) and [Usage Ingestion Pipeline](architecture/usage-ingestion-pipeline.md).
- **Operations:** Follow step-by-step instructions, including [runbooks](operations/runbooks.md), [troubleshooting tips](operations/troubleshooting.md), and [security controls](operations/security/openai-admin-security-controls.md).
- **Contributing:** Learn how to [submit documentation updates](contributing/documentation.md) and follow the [Developer Workflow](contributing/developer-workflow.md).

## Get involved

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies.
2. Run `npm run docs` from the project root to preview changes locally.
3. Open a pull request with screenshots or diagrams when relevant.

Maintaining trusted documentation is part of our Definition of Done. If you spot outdated guidance, propose an edit or file an issue so the team can triage it quickly.
