# Welcome

CogniTrack Docs is the centralized home for onboarding, architecture decisions, and operational guides. These pages are generated with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and live alongside the codebase, enabling engineers to iterate on documentation with the same workflows used for application code.

## What you will find

- **Product context:** Understand the CogniTrack vision, goals, and success metrics in the [Product section](product/prd.md).
- **Architecture references:** Review diagrams, data flows, and integration contracts starting with the [architecture overview](architecture/overview.md).
- **Operations:** Follow step-by-step instructions for day-to-day operations, including [runbooks](operations/runbooks.md) and [security controls](operations/security/openai-admin-security-controls.md).
- **Contributing:** Learn how to [submit documentation updates](contributing/documentation.md) and keep knowledge current.

## Get involved

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies.
2. Run `npm run docs` from the project root to preview changes locally.
3. Open a pull request with screenshots or diagrams when relevant.

Maintaining trusted documentation is part of our Definition of Done. If you spot outdated guidance, propose an edit or file an issue so the team can triage it quickly.
