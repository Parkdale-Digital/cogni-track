# Welcome

CogniTrack Docs is the centralized home for onboarding, architecture decisions, and operational guides. These pages are generated with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and live alongside the codebase, enabling engineers to iterate on documentation with the same workflows used for application code.

## What you will find

- **Product context:** Understand the CogniTrack vision, goals, and success metrics.
- **Architecture references:** Review diagrams, data flows, and integration contracts.
- **Runbooks:** Follow step-by-step instructions for day-to-day operations and incident response.

Get started by reading the [architecture overview](architecture/overview.md) and [operations runbooks](operations/runbooks.md). Contributions are welcomeâ€”open a pull request whenever you spot an opportunity to improve the docs.
