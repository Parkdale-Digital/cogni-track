# OpenAI Admin Data Security Review

**Date:** 2025-10-01  
**Time:** 10:00â€“10:45 PT  
**Attendees:** Maya (Security), Jamal (Infra), Codex liaison  
**Artifacts:**
- `docs/openai_admin_security_controls.md`
- `docs/openai_admin_migration_design.md`
- `audit/admin-api-fixtures/ENDPOINTS.md`
- `audit/spike-results/admin_ingestion_spike.json`

## Objectives
1. Validate RBAC + encryption controls for admin tables (`openai_service_account_keys`, certificate data).
2. Confirm monitoring metrics + alert thresholds for admin sync failures.
3. Approve logging sanitizer plan for redacted fields and fingerprints.

## Agenda
1. Overview of admin data ingestion flow (5 min)
2. Data classification & access boundaries review (10 min)
3. Logging + monitoring walkthrough (10 min)
4. Open questions & decision log (15 min)
5. Next actions + sign-off checklist (5 min)

## Pre-Read Questions
- Are additional controls required for storing certificate fingerprints under SOC2?
- Does SecOps need near-real-time alerting for service-account key rotation events?
- Should we extend audit webhook payload to include ingestion cursor metadata?

## Expected Outcomes
- Signed decision on RBAC scope for analytics users.
- Agreement on alert thresholds and ownership for follow-up.
- List of remediation tasks (if any) with deadlines.
