# Telemetry Audit Evidence Log

## Objective
Maintain artefacts (screenshots, CSV excerpts, diff reports) that demonstrate parity between `usage_events` rows and OpenAI completions exports.

## Capture Guidance
- [ ] Store raw CSV snippets (anonymized) that highlight each required column.
- [ ] Attach screenshots from manual spot-checks covering three distinct project tiers.
- [ ] Document tool/version details for scripted diffs.
- [ ] Summarize findings and confidence adjustments in `memorybank/daily_usage_alignment_plan.md` after each audit.
