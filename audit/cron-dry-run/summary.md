# Daily Usage Cron Dry-Run Summary

## Purpose
Track 48-hour staging executions of the daily usage cron when `ENABLE_DAILY_USAGE_WINDOWS` is enabled for telemetry validation without impacting production.

## Checklist
- [ ] Record start/end timestamps for each staging run.
- [ ] Confirm `CRON_SECRET` header is accepted in staging via `curl` smoke test before scheduling (see `docs-site/docs/operations/daily-usage-cron-runbook.md`).
- [ ] Capture `telemetry` payload from `/api/cron/daily-usage` response and append JSON snippet below.
- [ ] Note throttling or Retry-After headers observed; link to logs if available.
- [ ] Verify no simulated keys (`simulatedKeys === 0`).
- [ ] Verify `windowsProcessed` matches expected day count × key count.
- [ ] File follow-up issues for any non-zero `issuesByCode` entries.

## Runs
<!-- Append newest entries to the top of this section. -->

#### 2025-10-08T20:04Z (Smoke Test)
- Request: `curl -i -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" https://cogni-track-replit.vercel.app/api/cron/daily-usage` ([log](smoke-20251008T200417Z.log))
- Windows processed: 0 (expected 0 — baseline smoke run only)
- Updated events: 0
- Issues by code: {}
- Retry-After headers: none
- Notes: Flag `ENABLE_DAILY_USAGE_WINDOWS` confirmed true; staging returned `processed:1`/`successful:1` with no warnings.
- Artefacts: N/A (response payload embedded in log)

### Pending Artefacts
- [ ] 48-hour cron rehearsal telemetry appended below (minimum two runs).
- [ ] Corresponding notes committed under `audit/cron-dry-run/notes-<date>.md` using the template.
- [ ] Parity diff JSON for the rehearsal stored under `audit/telemetry-audit/` and linked in notes.

### Telemetry Fields Reference
- `windowsProcessed`: Should equal number of (days × active keys) for the run window.
- `updatedEvents`: Non-zero values expected on backfill retries; investigate spikes.
- `issuesByCode`: If populated, cross-reference `src/lib/usage-fetcher.ts` issue enums before escalating.
- `manualFallbackWindows`: Signals dedupe fallback usage; if >0 for two consecutive runs, open an ingestion ticket.
